console.log('functions built in');

// primer, overview, more details through rest of the course
// functions allow us to group together sets of statements, often noted by semi-colon end, grouped together and generate an output
// functions take in data known as arguments, perform some work or statement, and return a value
// difference between method and function but not much
// lots of built in functions in the browser - console.log(), Math.floor(), etc.
// examples - parse.Float(), parse.Int(), Date.now()

// functions can work with the DOM
const p = document.querySelector('p');
console.log(p);
