    // semi-colon used to define a statement, often at end of JS line
    // any time you want to do some in JS, it's called a statement
    // don't need semi-colon after code block {} - these would be function
    // definitions, if, loops, etc.

    // ASI = automatic semicolon insertion
    // don't have to use semi-colon, best to learn with them

    // 'use strict'; forces variables to be declared with var, let, or const

    // var and let can be updated, const cannot
    // var variables function scoped
    // let and const are block scoped or within {}

    // const by default, change to let if needs to change, almost never use var

    // function scoped
    const first = 'wes';

    // block scoped
    let age = 300;
    const cool = true;

    // don't need let or var when redefining variable
    age = 400;

    // as a convention, variables should not start with a capital letter
    // unless they are a class

    // $ associated with JQuery, _ associated with Lodash

    // const variable cannot be changed and will error
    const Dog = 'bowser'; // bad naming form since this is not a class

    // camel case - every word inside variable contains an upper case except first one
    const iLovePizza = true;

    // UpperCamelCase
    const ILoveToEatHotDogs = false;

    // snake case! ESLint doesn't like this format
    // const this_is_snake_case = 'cool';

    // kebab case - not allowed in JS because dashes are not allowed
    // const this-is-an-example = cool;
